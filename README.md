### Project Description
Our project focuses on creating a web application that enables users to generate daily schedules based on task priority and duration. The tool allows users to input tasks, set their priorities, specify durations, and define their available time slots. Based on this information, the application generates a clear and structured timetable that allocates tasks optimally.

### The Problem statement
Managing daily tasks efficiently is a common challenge, especially when there are multiple tasks with varying priorities and durations. Most existing tools lack an intuitive way to allocate time effectively based on task priority and duration within a given schedule. This often leads to poorly structured plans, inefficient time usage, and difficulty in maintaining consistency.

There is a need for a scheduling tool that helps users create a structured timetable by prioritizing tasks and considering their durations. This tool should automate the allocation of time slots for tasks while allowing users to define preferences, such as break times, to ensure a practical and manageable schedule.

### The Solution
Our solution is a web-based scheduling tool that simplifies the process of creating structured daily timetables. By considering task priority, duration, and available time slots, the tool ensures efficient time allocation for all tasks while allowing flexibility for breaks.

Key features of the solution include:

Task Management: Users can input tasks with their respective durations and assign priorities (High, Medium, Low).
Break Customization: Users can set preferred intervals and durations for breaks, ensuring a balanced schedule.
Automated Scheduling: The tool dynamically generates a timetable by prioritizing tasks and fitting them into the available time slots based on user input.
Visual Schedule Representation: The generated timetable is displayed in a clean and easy-to-read tabular format.
This solution directly addresses the challenge of poor time management by providing a systematic approach to planning daily tasks. It helps users focus on high-priority tasks while accommodating all activities within their available time frame.
